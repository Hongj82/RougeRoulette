# Rouge-Roulette
INFO 350 Project 

Game project idea:
- Turn based game where the player will be facing the dealer in a game of Russian Roulette with a twist.  The player and the dealer will be shooting each other while both have an x set amount of lives and once the set lives depletes the game will be over declaring a winner.  During the gameplay, there will be different items that can be used to give the player or the dealer an advantage. Items will be introduced later into the rounds giving the players an ability to choose specific items to use.

Mechanics:
- The dealer and the player will play 5 rounds. Starting round 2, 2 items will be given randomly from the items listed below.  The objective of the game is to deplete the dealers health.
- You can either choose to shoot yourself or the dealer.
- There is a chance that the chamber that is loaded with ammo is empty.

Items:
- Bullet proof vest (reduce damage taken)
- Gun oil (lubricates the gun reducing the chance of a jam)
- Alcohol (taking a shot allows you to spin the revolver)
- Defibrillator (Gives one extra life)
- Rope (Binds the dealer in return skipping their turn)

etc..
